  "The concept for Our Blind Mouse came from the way that life seems to often play out for visionaries, they have an idea and although they don't see it with their eyes they can see it in their minds. In pursuit of this vision they move by instinct, hope, and faith. Instinct is quite a wild animalistic sense, I felt the brand needed an animal to represent this however it had to be something that moved with hope and faith. <p> I then came across Matthew 5 v5:</p>\n\n <blockquote> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. </blockquote>\n\n My animal had to be meek and led by instinct, it's survival based entirely around faith, so I chose a blind mouse.";

If you have any ideas that you think I could help bring to life donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.";
